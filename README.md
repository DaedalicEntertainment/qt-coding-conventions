# Qt Coding Conventions

This document summarizes the high-level coding conventions for writing Qt client code at Daedalic Entertainment. They are based on the official Qt Coding Conventions:

* https://wiki.qt.io/Coding_Conventions
* https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_Coding_Style

We are providing a complete summary here in order to allow people to understand the conventions at a glance, instead of having to open multiple documents. Minor exceptions and additions are _highlighted in italic_.

In case we've missed recent changes to the official Qt coding conventions, or you can spot any other issue, please [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).
